    <h1>Owl</h1>
    <p class="smaller"><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>
    <p>Owls are birds from the order <strong>Strigiformes</strong>, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include <em>the diurnal northern hawk-owl</em> and <em>the gregarious burrowing owl</em>.

    Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except polar ice caps and some remote islands.
    
    Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, <strong>Strigidae</strong>, and the barn-owl family, <strong>Tytonidae</strong>.
       A group of owls is called <em>a "parliament."</em></p>
